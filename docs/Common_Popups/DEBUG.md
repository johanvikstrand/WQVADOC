The debug view is intended for developers and for debugging. It displays all tags connected to the object and allows all of them to be manipulated. At the top of the page are all tags which are defined as booleans. They can be turned on/off by just clicking the button. Holding the mouse over any button will also display a tooltip with a short description of the variable.

At the bottom of the page are all tags which are not booleans. Their value can be set to anything. 

**Note:** The non-boolean values are not updated automatically. The user has to press "refresh" in order to get the latest value for the non-boolean tags.
