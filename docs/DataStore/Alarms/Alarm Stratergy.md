Alarm Stratergy
=====


An alarm strategy is an important aspect of a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system, as it helps to ensure the safety, reliability, and efficiency of the process being monitored. An effective alarm strategy should balance the need for timely notification of issues with the need to minimize false alarms, which can lead to operator fatigue and decreased effectiveness.
