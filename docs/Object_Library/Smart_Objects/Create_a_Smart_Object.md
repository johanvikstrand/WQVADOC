Create a Smart Object
======================
To create a Smart Object there are five steps to follow. The steps to follow are:

- Chose a symbol that represents the object you want to create, for instance a pump symbol from the Object Library.
- Pick a number of [support objects](Support_Objects/index.md) that will highlight information about the object.
- Pick a [dynTouch](Support_Objects/dynTouch.md) from the object library and group all, ++ctrl+g++ , of the objects together.
- Once the objects are grouped, go through the properties tab and fill out any properties needed for the support objects, information of what they need can be found in their individual page.
- Start WideQuick VA and confirm that the object tag have been connected.
