## Analog Value Display Bottom
Analog Value Display gives a visual representation of a signal relative to its limits. This is a powerful way of representing data when the raw data is hard to put into context. For example a certain cubic meter of a fluid might only provide useful information if you know how big the tank is relative to that number. Use this when low values are the area of concern.
