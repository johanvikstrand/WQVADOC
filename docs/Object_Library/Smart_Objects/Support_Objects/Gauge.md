Gauge
====
Gauge is a support object that displays a tag value in a half circle as well as a numeric with unit. Best practise when using this object is to disconnect it and feed the min and max values into WideQuick Designer. However, if you desire for the gauge to be more flexible in runtime use dynamics.
