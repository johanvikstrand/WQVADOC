Smart Objects
====================

With Smart Objects the user can with ease connect a tags to any object in WideQuick with the help of a couple of objects from the [Object Library](../../Object_Library/index.md). These objects can be divided into:

 - [Support Objects](Support_Objects/index.md) 
 - [Symbols](../Symbols/index.md)
