Git
===================
As this thesis project aims to be embryo of KentimaÂ´s Water and Wastewater Treatment application in the future it is important to have clear guidelines of how development enfolds as the number of developers and users increase. The following is a number of ways that we intend to maintain our codebase.

The Git will as of right now be hosted on GitHub

**Version Handling** will eventually be handled by Kentima's developer server.

## Git Workflow
 The workflow chosen is Feature Branch Workflow. This means every added feature, in this projects case smart objects or work-views for the SCADA, is developed in a separate branch. This makes it so that multiple developers can work simultaneously without disturbing the main codebase, maintaining a main branch without broken code. Another advantage is the ease of making discussion around a feature by pull requests. <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow" target="_blank">Read more here!</a>
