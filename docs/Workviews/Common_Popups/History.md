The history page allows the user to view historic values of a tag using a database. All tags will be listed in a list. The user can then select which tag(s) they want to follow. There are also settings available to hide/show both the ruler and the legend. It is also possible to choose a tracking interval, with 0 meaning that the graph won't update.

**Note:** In order for this to work, the selected tag must be logged to a database using a logger. If a non-logged variable is selected no data will be shown.

If serveral loggers are logging the selected variable, the logger with the highest sampling frequency will be chosen.
