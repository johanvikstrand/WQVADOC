Tab is the starting view of any object that will come up when the user clicks on any dynTouch. The tab view shows the properties of the object, such as: connect, device and system. The tab view also allows the user to select which suffix the [value select](../Object_Library/Smart_Objects/Support_Objects/Value_Select.md) support object will display.
