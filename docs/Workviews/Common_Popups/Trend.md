The trend view works similarly to the [history popup](/docs/Workviews/Common_Popups/History.md). However the trend view is not able to show historic values of a tag and instead starts tracking the tag value once the user selects the specific tag. This does however allow all tags to be displayed and tracked since they do not need to be logged to a database. Also on the trend view are some settings, such as: show/hide legend and also the ability to change the scale of the Y-axis.
